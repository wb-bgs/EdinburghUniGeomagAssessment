# University of Edinburgh Geomagnetism Tutorials

Tutorials for the 4th year Geomagnetism course, see https://github.com/wb-bgs/EdUniGeomagTutorials.

## Contents
Instructions for this tutorial are given in ``Geomagnetism Spherical Harmonic Tutorial.pdf``, download this from the Github page or Learn.

In the ``notebooks`` directory:
 1. ``Spherical-Harmonic-Models-1.ipynb``
     - representation and evaluation of the IGRF
 2. ``Spherical-Harmonic-Models-2.ipynb``
     - building SH models of Earth's land

## Running the Jupyter Notebooks with Binder
You can run the notebooks interactively online by using the link below. After the page loads, navigate to ``notebooks`` and select one of the notebooks.

## Instructions to set up on your own machine
Prerequisite: You will need an installation of Python 3.6+ with recent versions of numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy, jupyter. 
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is the recommended way to install all this.
Once you have that, you should be able to download or clone the materials, and run the Jupyter Notebooks locally, e.g. on a Linux machine you could use:
```
git clone https://github.com/wb-bgs/EdUniGeomagTutorials.git ./GeomagTutorials
cd GeomagTutorials
jupyter notebook
```

##  Based on material from the IAGA Summer School 2019
These tutorials are based on https://github.com/MagneticEarth/IAGA_SummerSchool2019

Materials for the workshop on magnetic observatories and modelling. 
Tutorials are written in Python as Jupyter Notebooks and can be found in the ``notebooks`` directory.
