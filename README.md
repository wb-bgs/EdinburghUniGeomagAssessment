# EdinburghUniGeomagAssessment

## Getting started

This code helps you answer the assignment questions which are distributed separately through Learn.

### Using Noteable:

- First, navigate to the Noteable link within the Geomagnetism course area on Learn and login to Noteable
- Choose a "GeoScience Notebook" from the drop down menu, and click "Start"
- Then, select a "Terminal" session from the Noteable launch tab
- Pull in the code repo:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/wb-bgs/EdinburghUniGeomagAssessment.git .
  ```
- Navigate on the left side bar in the Noteable window to the notebook file "EdinburghUniGeomagAssessment/notebooks/GeomagnetismAssessment.ipynb"
- If you need to reset the code completely and/or pull in updates (*wiping your changes*), open a terminal and do:
  ```
  cd ~/EdinburghUniGeomagAssessment
  git fetch
  git reset --hard origin/main
  ```

### DIY:

- Use your own Python 3 environment (you may choose to [install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), or just [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for a more lightweight option)
- Ensure you have `matplotlib` and `pandas` installed
- Pull in the code repo:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/wb-bgs/EdinburghUniGeomagAssessment.git .
  ```
- Navigate to `EdinburghUniGeomagAssessment/notebooks/GeomagnetismAssessment.ipynb`
