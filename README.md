# EdinburghUniGeomagAssessment

## Getting started

This code helps you answer the assignment questions which are distributed separately through Learn.

### Using Noteable:

- First, login and launch a "GeoScience Notebook" at <https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login>
- Then, click [this link to pull in the code and open the notebook](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwb-bgs%2FEdinburghUniGeomagAssessment&urlpath=tree%2FEdinburghUniGeomagAssessment%2Fnotebooks%2FGeomagnetismAssessment.ipynb&branch=main)
- If you need to reset the code completely and/or pull in updates (*wiping your changes*), open a terminal and do:
  ```
  cd ~/EdinburghUniGeomagAssessment
  git fetch
  git reset --hard origin/main
  ```

### DIY:

- Use your own Python 3 environment (you may choose to [install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), or just [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for a more lightweight option)
- Ensure you have `matplotlib` and `pandas` installed
- Pull in the code repo:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/wb-bgs/EdinburghUniGeomagAssessment.git
  ```
- Navigate to `EdinburghUniGeomagAssessment/notebooks/GeomagnetismAssessment.ipynb`
